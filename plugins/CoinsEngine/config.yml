General:
  # Here you can create custom amount shortcuts to use in commands.
  # For example, with default settings you can use values like 1K (1000), 5KK or 5M (5 millions), 7KKK or 7B (7 billions).
  # Also, this has addictive behavior, so using, for example, 2MM will result in 2 * (million * million)
